- packaging: 

  - uninstall

- improvements:

  - document the new event system for nodes (see op.c and image.c,
    where the event loop resides)

  - move event loop to event.h/c ? we do not necessarily want to
    display the network when using events, but how to make sure that
    mint_poll_events is called just once? can we add an events op to
    networks and have that one do the job? 

  - expand use of WEIGHTS_LOOP macro

  - keep track of pointers in spread reset of matrix targets, to avoid
    potentially resetting twice

  - have MINT save network state and exit cleanly on SIGUSR? it should
    not be hard to write a signal handler and have network_load add
    the network to a list of networks (and network_del remove it from
    there)

  - getting image from camera should work as fast as possible
    regardless of max camera framerate, returning an identical image
    to the last one from the camera if necessary.

  - inner loop in image_paste could be optimized by replacing the if
    on the index with a calculation to begin and end loops at
    appropriate indices...

  - DOCUMENT THIS: network init ops may set spread. if spread is set,
    run_spread op is added and the spread is performed. other network
    operate ops are run prior to spreading (threaded spread overrides
    the default run spread - see threads.c)

  - mint_weights_set assumes indices in sparse matrix cind variables
    are sorted, but mint_weights_set_row does not check...

  - lateral processing weights op can be turned into receptive field
    op by allowing nfrom to be different from nto!

- to be tested:

  - freezing/unfreezing of weight matrices and networks

- display:

  - better layout, somehow display weights or at least connections

- mint_pi:

  - test sensor functions

- threads:

  - write common code to fill in the thread data structures? it could
    easily be the same for nodes and weights!

- ops system:

  - make matrix target an op

  - can direct-output nodes be set through an op? yes: by setting n[1]
    to the same as n[0]... carefully. is this safe? how to prevent
    memory to be wasted? 

- weights init functions that build receptive fields and topographic
  mappings

- make it possible to set inputs by "shallow copy" (pointer
  assignment)? would make things much faster when presenting many
  different stimuli repeatedly, especially large stimuli like
  realistic images.


- sense organs   

  - human cone system (cone data in egs-devel/physiology)

  - generic rearrangement-intensity scheme

mint_nodes mint_2d_stim( int size, float x, float h, float d ) {
  int i;
  mint_nodes n;
  float aux;
  n = mint_nodes_new( size, 0 );
  for( i=0; i<size; i++ ) {
    aux = (i-x)/d;
    n[1][i] += h * exp( -aux*aux );
  }
  return n;
}


- worth it? 

  - grow/shrink node arrays and weight matrices (cf. nodes_resize)
    MEDIUM

  - population and mutation for genetic algorithms MEDIUM

  - virtual environment COMPLEX


- minor tweaks:
  
  - when resize is done for nodes, rename it to mint_nodes_set_size,
    and rename mint_nodes_size to mint_nodes_get_size, for consistency
    with other objects


- improve error management: 

  - specify also num states for from and to in weight update rules?

- examples:

  - make sure all examples work, have same file layout, and have a
    README.txt file


- MPI: 

  - think about it!
