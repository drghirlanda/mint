The MINT neural network simulation library

Welcome. The MINT manual is in doc/manual/mint.pdf. The reference
manual can be accessed opening doc/html/index.html in a web browser.

In a nutshell: MINT is a C library for neural netwrok simulation,
meant to be flexible yet economic in resources. You find some examples
of how it can be used inthe example/ directory. To install:

On a POSIX system (Linux, Mac OSX) you can run the /install.sh script
and follow the directions.

On a Windows system you have two options:

  1. Turn Windows into a POSIX system by installing Cygwin
  (www.cygwin.org), then run install.sh as above.

  2. Compile the source files in src/ yourself into a library (if you
  write a project file for a Windows development environment, please
  send it to drghirlanda@gmail.com). The files are ANSI C89 (ISO C90)
  and should compile in any decent environment.
