To install: 

On a POSIX system (Linux, Mac OSX) you can run the /install.sh script
and follow the directions.

On a Windows system you have two options:

  1. Turn Windows into a POSIX system by installing Cygwin
  (www.cygwin.org), then run install.sh as above.

  2. Compile the source files in src/ yourself into a library (if you
  write a project file for a Windows development environment, please
  send it to me). The files are ANSI C89 (ISO C90) and should compile
  in any decent environment.
